V1 - Found a Trader Joes Rest API online somewhere, and started to set up the routing and some of the layouts. 
Haven't learned how to properly import imgs in react to where you're able to manipulate them better(which is why the navbar is insanely huge), but that will probably be a step I'll figure out later. 

V2 should just be fetching the api and displaying it on the screen in the "foods" page. I will also be setting up the "about" page with more information on Trader Joes. Victorian images will also be thrown around in there   .... in typical Trader Joes fashion!
